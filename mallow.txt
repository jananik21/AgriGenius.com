1.)Given an array with n distinct integers d[0], d[1], … d[n – 1] and a threshold t, how many triplets (i, j, k) exist such that d[i] < d[j] < d[k], and d[i] + d[j] + d[k] <= t. 
Sample Input:
t => Threshold, N=> No. of values in array then N number follows denotes values..
8 5 1 2 3 4 6

Sample Output:
3
Explanation:

{1, 2, 3} => 1 + 2 + 3 <= 8
{1, 2, 4} => 1 + 2 + 4 <= 8
{1, 3, 4} => 1 + 3 + 4 <= 8

2.)Louise and Richard decided to stay in on Friday night to play a game. They have a counter set to N. Louise gets the first turn and they alternate turns thereafter.
In the game, they perform one of the following two operations.
If N is not a power of 2, they reduce the counter by the largest power of 2 less than N.If N is a power of 2, they reduce the counter by half of N. The resultant value is the new N which is by the next player for her or his turn. The game ends when the counter reduces to 1, i.e. N = 1. The player who makes the last valid move (i.e. who gets to 1) wins. Given N, your task is to find the winner of the game.

Note: If the counter is set to 1 at the start, Richard wins, because its Louise’s turn and she
cannot make a move.

Input Format:

The first line contains an integer T, the number of test cases. T lines follow. Each line contains N, the initial number set in the counter.
Output Format:
For each test case, print the winner’s name in a new line. So if Louise wins the game, print “Louise”. Otherwise, print “Richard” (minus the quotation marks.)

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 10
1 <= N <= 264 - 1

Sample Input:
1 6

Sample Output
Richard
Explanation
6 is not a power of 2, so Louise subtracts the largest power of 2 less than 6, i.e. 4, and the counter goes down to 2. 2 is a power of 2, so Richard reduces the counter by half of 2, i.e. 1, and the counter goes down to 1. Since N = 1, Louise has no more moves, so Richard wins the game

3.)You are given a 14 digit date time value as input (D), whose format is YYYYMMDDHHMISS.
YYYY – represents year (Examples: 1947, 2000, 2015)
MM – represents month (Examples: 12, 01, 03)
DD – represents day (Examples: 31, 01, 15)
HH – represents hour (Examples: 00, 01, 12, 23)
MI – represents minute (Examples: 59, 50, 00, 05)
SS – represents second (Examples: 59, 50, 00 06)

You will also be given another integer, called the offset value (O), in seconds. You are required
to print a 14 digit output date in the format YYYYMMDDHHMISS which is adjusted for the offset from the input date.
